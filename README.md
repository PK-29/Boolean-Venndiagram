# Problem
As a TA for a first year python course, Students were having a problem understanding and visualizing the concept of bitwise operations such as "and", "or", "xor" and "not". Students having trouble remembering the results for boolean operators and as the inputs increase with a variation of the operators, it becomes confusing them. This selected problem will help more students with visualizing and differentiating the logic behind boolean operators in a simple way everyone can remember.

# Solution
This solution includes giving students a visual of how boolean operators work through Venn diagrams. The idea is that they select the inputs and operators from a set of options we give them and the Venn diagram will be colored accordingly Ex. A and B would light up the union of the circles. Goal of the solution was to give them a complete, simple and visual interface in a non-confusing way they can grasp the concepts and avoid any reading involved in the solution and make it intuitive as possible.
